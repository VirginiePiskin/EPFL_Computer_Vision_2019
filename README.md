EPFL Autumn Semester 2019 - Computer Vision Course

- https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/computer-vision-CS-442

This repository contains the assignments on which I worked during the semester.
Blank notebooks were given to us to be filled every two weeks. The code in these
notebooks were written by myself using the class material (lectures).
I also used the exercise solutions to verify and complete my implementation
whenever needed. The exam notebook here was filled in real exam conditions:
2 hours without the help of the Internet.

Content of the notebooks:

- Session 1: Getting Started with Computer Vision
  - Image Segmentation
  - Background Substraction
  - Connected Components

- Session 2: Convolution, Filtering and Gradients
  - Applying Convolutional Filters
  - Image Smoothing
  - Edge Detector
  - Separable Filters

- Session 3: Edge Detection and Delineation
  - Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm

- Session 4: K-means Clustering and Image Sharpening
  - Depth Based Segmentation
  - Location Based Segmentation
  - Image Sharpening

- Session 5: Shape From Stereo
  - Normalized Cross Correlation
  - Disparity Map

- Exam: General Hough Transform
